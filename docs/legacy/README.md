Legacy Docs Naming Convention
=============================

This folder groups the legacy migration documents in a predictable order so
both humans and tooling can find the right reference quickly.

Naming scheme
-------------
- 00-INDEX.md     : entry point (what to read depending on the task)
- 10-PLAN.md      : checklist / acceptance criteria
- 20-RUNBOOK.md   : step-by-step commands and validation procedure
- 30-REFERENCE.md : canonical legacy install contract
- 40-STATUS.md    : current summary / progress snapshot

Guideline
---------
- Keep one source of truth per topic.
- Update 40-STATUS.md after any significant change or validation run.
